# How to use
This is FontAwesome 6.1.1 Version. To use that just copy the all.min.css file from css folder to your project css folder and link it up. keep the webfonts folder out of css folder.
You can try to link up this <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css"> instead of adding file folder.
